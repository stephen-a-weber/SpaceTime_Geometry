Swift programs to view and manipulate spacetime geometry of quarks
These are my programs to show visually the geometry of spacetime.
I intend to write up a paper and instead of just showing math such as SU(3) U(1) and matrices. I found a purely geometric 
way to visualize the quark within the standard model.

I am currently working on how to connect the current work on gluons which bind quarks to quarks
in order to make animation through time.

Currently I can show that in the standard model there are three matter quarks which make up our nucleons
I place space itself as an arrangement grid or coordinate system using hexagon gridding. Such that
space is like a sea of marbles, each marble is a unit of space. In a plane there are always six spheres
that touch the origin sphere. 

A grouping of a single ring around an origin sphere is a quark. MAthematically in that case. This being seven units o
of space. This tiles all of a plane. Pure hexagon mathematics. And so all of space is just a sea of quarks.
I do not project extra dimensions aside from time for the three dimensions of space that we all know.
I use the string theory representation of space. In that . At the scale of a single marble, at the scale
of a single quark, at this scale string theory projects that there are eleven dimensions that are
linearly independent that are composed out of the base vectors of our three normal space dimensions. All 
All curled up within the space of a single unit of space.

Mathematically I show in these programs which output graphic pictures of these geometrys, that there are 38 
possible mathematical configurations of 3 quarks located together in space. (Note a mirror antimatter version also
exists).

Each quark has charge which occilates back or forth in one of the three axis of hexagons. But noting that
I am saying along an axis .
If one groups all of the possible combinations of 3 quarks as done in these programs,
they can be sorted into any of eleven possible groups. By definition the quark takes up space.
And the charges are constricted to move in eleven linearly independent ways through space. 

That is I show the connection between the standard model of physics with quarks, and string theories 
(M theory ) that demand there to be eleven curled up dimensions.

I posit that one of the 38 combinational groupings of quarks is the proton, one the neutron. 
Like all mathematical objects and Einsteins joke. Everything is relative. I need to research the math
of SU(3) and the eight gluon ideas.

But for starters.
Gluons have eight linearly independent directions.
I posit the obvious.
The main thrust here is a plane for quarks. But tiling in 3D is obviously possible.
The gluons being linearly independent are based on 90 degree or orthogonal mathematics.
Hexagon mathematics rely on 60 degrees which produce coordinates that are not independent. To go north in 
hexagons we must tack left/up right/up left/up right/up to just end up up..
But here is the thing.
In a plane the quarks have six independent directions. Any sphere at any size ALWAYS has six identically sized
spheres that fit snugly around the original sphere.
So in a plane a quark has six independent directions.

There are several ways to stack marbles. The real way is that each plane is offset, such that any
sphere or marble has six in one plane , and immediately above it connects with three others. Also with 
three below. This means the best sphere packing has twelve directions.

But current talk about qluons are describing linearly independent in orthogonal (90 degree) coordinate system.

So we can just stack each plane of marbles or quarks orthogonally. Such that above and below each quark is
another quark. This adds two linearly independent directions to each quark.

So six plus two is eight. I am glossing over a correct explanation for why in a plane I am claiming that 
all six directions (sphere to sphere like) are addably linearly independent. 

They obviously are based on how the quarks are presented. I just am working through my understanding of 
the best description of space. And I want to stick with a homogenous space. Space that is that is the 
same description in all directions. So in that case each plane of marbles shouldn't balance each marble 
on top of each other. They should all slide into the space left by threee marbles below.
This means any unit of space is connected with 12 others.

BUT the good news is that in the math of gluons the current work is stuck in orthogonal coordinate space
so they only use 8, but there are more ways that they can be rearrainged. In hexagon math there is REDUNDANT 
information. At the quark level and smaller I posit that the redundancy ends. Current physics
throws out thinking in hexagon space because there is always redundant information. But by throwing out this redundant
information they end up stuck when looking at the quark scale.

Every internet page, the layman arguements all end up apologizing for only needing eight out of nine. 
saying the obvious nineth one has a zero effect. I won't get into that here. But to me. That nineth one
is what gives original 3quark its stability. The rest can be used to describe the animation through time
of how quarks interact. But in my geometry I always choose a grid describing three quarks. 

For a quick jump into what I am talking about, I have a file called pictures. Most of the programs are set
up so that I can paint quarks like a chalkboard. 

TO DO.
1) study SU(3) GellMan Equation, with gluon. find my 12 gluon coordinate system

2) I need to work on drag and drop with rotate so that I can move 3quarks quicker.

3) color coating trial for quark colors

4) A bit on describing up close the way spheres exactly 21 in 3 X 6 around 1, have three flavors and how
  the reverse side is the mirror image but not symetric with the original. This is what is lost in
  physics by ignoring hexagons due to redundant information. At this scale the physical geometry itself
  gives the laws of the standard model.
